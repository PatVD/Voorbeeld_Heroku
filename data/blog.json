    "detail": "Once in a while you stumble upon a band that blows you away with such unexpected freshness and brilliance, that you're convinced they'll conquer the world in a matter of weeks. I'm still waiting, but Khruangbin is such a band. Consisting of only three the band makes intimate music that somehow sounds larger than a passing parade. Celebrating life, traveling and good company. With 'White Glove' as a lovely tribute to a deceased feline. Majestic happy little clouds they are. Favorite track: Mr. White."
